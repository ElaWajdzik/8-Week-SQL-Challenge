For this case study there is a total of 4 datasets for this case study - however you will only need to utilise 2 main tables to solve all of the regular questions, and the additional 2 tables are used only for the bonus challenge question!

- ``product_details`` includes all information about the entire range that Balanced Clothing sells in their store
- ``sales`` contains product level information for all the transactions made for Balanced Tree including quantity, price, percentage discount, member status, a transaction ID and also the transaction timestamp

## Question and Solution

I was using MySQL to solve the problem, if you are interested, the complete SQL code is available [here]().

**In advance, thank you for reading.** If you have any comments on my work, please let me know. My emali address is ela.wajdzik@gmail.com.

***
###  A. High Level Sales Analysis

#### 1. What was the total quantity sold for all products?

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(qty) AS total_quantity
FROM sales;
```

##### Result:

... cs7_a_1

There were 45216 products sold.

#### 2. What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(qty*price) AS revenue
FROM sales;
```

##### Result:

...cs7_a_2

The total revenue was $1 289 453 

#### 3. What was the total discount amount for all products?

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(qty*price*discount/100),2) AS total_discount
FROM sales;
```

To calculate the total discount, I used information about quantity (``qty``), price (``price``) and percentage discount (``discount``). I multiplied all three metrics and divided by 100 because ``discount`` in the table is an integer, not a percent.

##### Result:

...cs7_a_3

The total discount amount was $156 229.14

***
###  B. Transaction Analysis

#### 1. How many unique transactions were there?

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS number_of_transactions
FROM sales;
```

##### Result:

...cs7_b_1

There were 2500 unique transactions.

#### 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(number_of_different_products),0) AS average_unique_products
FROM (
    SELECT
        txn_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS number_of_different_products
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY txn_id) AS txn_sales;
```
##### Result:

...cs7_b_2

The average number of unique products in each transaction was equal to 6.


#### 3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

```sql
WITH txn_sales AS (
SELECT
    txn_id,
    SUM(qty*price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY txn_id
),
percentiles AS (
    SELECT
        revenue,
        PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue) AS percent_rank
    FROM txn_sales
),
25th_percentile AS (
SELECT
    MIN(revenue) AS 25th_perc
FROM percentiles
WHERE percent_rank >= 0.25
),
50th_percentile AS (
SELECT
    MIN(revenue) AS 50th_perc
FROM percentiles
WHERE percent_rank >= 0.5
),
75th_percentile AS (
SELECT
    MIN(revenue) AS 75th_perc
FROM percentiles
WHERE percent_rank >= 0.75
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 25th_percentile, 50th_percentile, 75th_percentile;
```

To calculate the percentile I need to use the function **PERCENT_RANK()** and after that I choose the value of revenue according to the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles.

##### Result:

...cs7_b_3


#### 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(discount),2) AS avg_discount
FROM (
    SELECT
        txn_id,
        SUM(qty*price*discount/100) AS discount
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY txn_id) AS txn_sales;
```

##### Result:

...cs7_b_4

The average discount for each transaction was $62.49.


#### 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?

```sql
WITH txn_sales AS (
    SELECT
        member,
        COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS number_of_transactions
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY member
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN member = 1 THEN 'members'
        ELSE 'non-members'
    END AS member,
    number_of_transactions,
    ROUND(number_of_transactions/(SUM(SUM(number_of_transactions)) OVER ())*100,1) AS proc_of_transactions
FROM txn_sales
GROUP BY member;
```

##### Steps:
- First, I created the temporary table ``txn_sales`` which contains the number of unique transactions for members and non-members.
- In the result I changed the value in column ``memeber`` from **1** and **0** to **members** and **non-members**. I calculated the percentage of all transactions for each group of clients.

##### Result:

... cs7_b_5

#### 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?

```sql
WITH txn_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        txn_id,
        member,
        SUM(qty*price) AS revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY txn_id, member
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN member = 1 THEN 'members'
        ELSE 'non-members'
    END AS member,
    ROUND(AVG(revenue),2) AS avg_revenue
FROM txn_revenue
GROUP BY member;
```

##### Result:

...cs7_b_6

The average revenue for transactions for members was $516.27 and for non-members was $515.04. The difference between those two values was only $1.23.

***
###  C. Product Analysis

#### 1. What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?


```sql
SELECT
    pd.product_name,
    SUM(s.qty*s.price) AS revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(s.qty*s.price)/(SUM(SUM(s.qty*s.price)) OVER ())*100,1) AS proc_of_revenue
FROM sales AS s, product_details AS pd
WHERE s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.product_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC LIMIT 3;
```

##### Result:

...cs7_c_1

The top 3 products by revenue were **Blue Polo Shirt - Mens** (revenue around $218k which is 16,9% of total revenue), **Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens** (revenue around $209k which is 16,2% of total revenue) and **White Tee Shirt - Mens** (revenue around $152k which is 11,8% of total revenue).

#### 2. What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?


```sql
SELECT
    pd.segment_name,
    SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity,
    SUM(s.qty *s.price) AS revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(s.qty * s.price * s.discount /100),2) AS total_discount
FROM sales AS s, product_details AS pd
WHERE s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.segment_name;
```

##### Result:

...cs7_c_2

#### 3. What is the top selling product for each segment?

NOTE. Top selling products can be calculated by revenue or by quantity sold.

Top selling products by quantity sold.
```sql
WITH product_sales AS (
SELECT
    pd.segment_name,
    pd.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pd.segment_name ORDER BY SUM(s.qty) DESC) AS selling_ranking,
    SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity,
    SUM(s.qty *s.price) AS revenue
FROM sales AS s, product_details AS pd
WHERE s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.segment_name, pd.product_name
)
SELECT
    segment_name,
    product_name,
    total_quantity,
    revenue
FROM product_sales
WHERE selling_ranking = 1;
```

##### Result:

by quantity sold
...cs7_c_3a


by revenue
...cs7_c_3b

In 3 of 4 segments, the same product generated the most revenue and the most sales. Only in the segment **Jeans** the products were different, **Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens** generated the biggest number of sales (3856) and **Black Straight Jeans - Womens** generated the biggest revenue (around $120k).

#### 4. What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each category?


```sql
SELECT
    pd.category_name,
    SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity,
    SUM(s.qty *s.price) AS revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(s.qty * s.price * s.discount /100),2) AS total_discount
FROM sales AS s, product_details AS pd
WHERE s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.category_name;
```

##### Result:

...cs7_c_4

#### 5. What is the top selling product for each category?

Like in question 3 we can calculate the top products by revenue or by quantity sold.

Top selling products by quantity sold.
```sql
WITH product_sales AS (
SELECT
    pd.category_name,
    pd.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pd.category_name ORDER BY SUM(s.qty) DESC) AS selling_ranking,
    SUM(s.qty) AS total_quantity,
    SUM(s.qty *s.price) AS revenue
FROM sales AS s, product_details AS pd
WHERE s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.category_name, pd.product_name
)
SELECT
    category_name,
    product_name,
    total_quantity,
    revenue
FROM product_sales
WHERE selling_ranking = 1;
```

##### Result:

by quantity sold
...cs7_c_5a


by revenue
...cs7_c_5a

The result is exactly the same.
