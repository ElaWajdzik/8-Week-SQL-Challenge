<img src="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/case-study-designs/6.png" alt="Image Clique Bait - attention capturing" height="400">

## Introduction

Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

## Available Data

For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which you will need to combine to solve all of the questions.

- ``Users`` - Customers who visit the Clique Bait website are tagged via their ``cookie_id``.
- ``Events`` - Customer visits are logged in this ``events`` table at a ``cookie_id`` level and the ``event_type`` and ``page_id`` values can be used to join into relevant satellite tables to obtain further information about each event. The ``sequence_number`` is used to order the events within each visit.
- ``Event Identifier`` - The ``event_identifier`` table shows the types of events which are captured by Clique Baitâ€™s digital data systems.
- ``Campaign Identifier`` - This table shows information for the 3 campaigns that Clique Bait has ran on their website so far in 2020.
- ``Page Hierarchy`` - This table lists all of the pages on the Clique Bait website which are tagged and have data passing through from user interaction events.

### 2. Digital Analysis

#### 1. How many users are there?

```sql
