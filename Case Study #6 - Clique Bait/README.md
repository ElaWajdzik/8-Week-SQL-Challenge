# Case Study #6: ðŸŽ£ Clique Bait
<img src="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/case-study-designs/6.png" alt="Image Clique Bait - attention capturing" height="400">

## Introduction

Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

## Available Data

For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which you will need to combine to solve all of the questions.

- ``Users`` - Customers who visit the Clique Bait website are tagged via their ``cookie_id``.
- ``Events`` - Customer visits are logged in this ``events`` table at a ``cookie_id`` level and the ``event_type`` and ``page_id`` values can be used to join into relevant satellite tables to obtain further information about each event. The ``sequence_number`` is used to order the events within each visit.
- ``Event Identifier`` - The ``event_identifier`` table shows the types of events which are captured by Clique Baitâ€™s digital data systems.
- ``Campaign Identifier`` - This table shows information for the 3 campaigns that Clique Bait has ran on their website so far in 2020.
- ``Page Hierarchy`` - This table lists all of the pages on the Clique Bait website which are tagged and have data passing through from user interaction events.

### 2. Digital Analysis

#### 1. How many users are there?

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS number_of_users
FROM users;
```

##### Step:
- 

##### Result:

| number_of_users |
|-----------------|
| 500             |


#### 2. How many cookies does each user have on average?

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(user_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT user_id),1) AS avg_number_of_cookis_per_user
FROM users;
```

##### Step:
- 
##### Result:

| avg_number_of_cookis_per_user |
|-------------------------------|
| 3.6                           |


#### 3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?


```sql
SELECT 
    MONTH(event_time) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_number_of_visit
FROM events
GROUP BY MONTH(event_time);
```

##### Step:
- 

##### Result:

#### 4. What is the number of events for each event type?

```sql
SELECT
    e.event_type,
    ei.event_name,
    COUNT(e.event_type) AS number_of_events
FROM events AS e, event_identifier AS ei
WHERE e.event_type = ei.event_type
GROUP BY event_type;
```

##### Step:
-

#### 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT e.visit_id)/n_visit.number_of_visit)*100,1) AS proc_of_visits_with_purchase
FROM events AS e, 
    (SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS number_of_visit
    FROM events) AS n_visit
WHERE event_type = 3;
```

##### Step:
- I used the functi

##### Result:

| proc_of_visits_with_purchase |
|------------------------------|
| 49.9                         |


#### 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?


```sql
WITH visit_checkout_purchase AS (
SELECT
    visit_id,
    MAX(CASE 
        WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1  
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS visit_with_purchase,
    MAX(CASE 
        WHEN page_id = 12 THEN 1 
        ELSE 0
    END) AS visit_with_checkout_page
FROM events
GROUP BY visit_id
)

SELECT
    SUM(visit_with_checkout_page)-SUM(visit_with_purchase) AS number_of_visit_with_checkout_without_purchase,
    ROUND(((SUM(visit_with_checkout_page)-SUM(visit_with_purchase))/COUNT(*))*100,1) AS proc_of_visit_with_checkout_without_purchase
FROM visit_checkout_purchase AS vcp;
```
