# Case Study #4: ðŸ’² Data Bank
<img src="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/case-study-designs/4.png" alt="Image Data Bank - That's money" height="400">

## Introduction
There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isnâ€™t only for banking activities, they also have the worldâ€™s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

## Available Data
The Data Bank team have prepared a data model for this case study as well as a few example rows from the complete dataset below to get you familiar with their tables.

## A. Customer Nodes Exploration
***

### 1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS number_of_nodes
FROM customer_nodes;
```
#### Steps:
- I counted the unique nodes using **COUNT DISTINCT**.

#### Result:
| number_of_nodes |
| --------------- |
| 5               |  

***

### 2. What is the number of nodes per region?

```sql
SELECT
    region_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS number_of_nodes
FROM customer_nodes
JOIN regions
    ON regions.region_id = customer_nodes.region_id
GROUP BY region_name;
```

#### Steps:
- I counted the number of unique nodes (using **COUNT DISTINCT**) in every region (using clause **GROUP BY**).

#### Result:
- Every region has five different nodes.

***

### 3. How many customers are allocated to each region?

```sql
SELECT
    region_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer_nodes
JOIN regions
    ON regions.region_id = customer_nodes.region_id
GROUP BY region_name;
```

#### Steps:
- I counted the number of customers (using **COUNT DISTINCT**) in every region (using clause **GROUP BY**).

#### Result:
- Every region has around 100 customers. The most customers were in Australia (110 customers), and the least in Europe (88 customers).

### 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(end_date,start_date)),1) AS avg_number_of_days
FROM customer_nodes
WHERE YEAR(end_date) < 9999;
```

#### Steps:
- I checked the max and min ``start_date`` and ``end_date``. 14% of records had ``end_data`` equal ``9999-12-31. I assumed that if a customer in a node hasÂ  ``end_date`` equal ``9999-12-31`` it means that it is a current node for this customer. That's why I used the clause **WHERE YEAR(end_date) < 9999** to limit the data.
- I used the clause **DATEDIFF** to calculate the number of days between start and end.
- I used the clause **AVG** to count the average number of days.

#### Result:
- On average, customers were rellocated to a different node in 14.6 days.


| avg_number_of_days |
| ------------------ |
| 14.6               |  


***

### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

```sql
WITH customer_nodes_with_percentile AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        DATEDIFF(end_date,start_date) AS number_of_days,
        ROUND(
            PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY region_id
                ORDER BY DATEDIFF(end_date,start_date)
            ) 
        ,2) AS percentile_rank
    FROM customer_nodes
    WHERE YEAR(end_date) < 9999),

80th_percentile AS (
SELECT 
    region_id,
    MIN(number_of_days) AS 80th_perc
FROM customer_nodes_with_percentile
WHERE percentile_rank >= 0.8
GROUP BY region_id),

95th_percentile AS (
SELECT 
    region_id,
    MIN(number_of_days) AS 95th_perc
FROM customer_nodes_with_percentile
WHERE percentile_rank >= 0.95
GROUP BY region_id),

50th_percentile AS (
SELECT 
    region_id,
    MIN(number_of_days) AS 50th_perc
FROM customer_nodes_with_percentile
WHERE percentile_rank >= 0.5
GROUP BY region_id)

SELECT 
    region_name,
    50th_perc,
    80th_perc,
    95th_perc
FROM regions
JOIN 50th_percentile AS 50th
    ON 50th.region_id = regions.region_id
JOIN 80th_percentile AS 80th
    ON 80th.region_id = regions.region_id
JOIN 95th_percentile AS 95th
    ON 95th.region_id = regions.region_id;
```

#### Steps:
- I created a temporary table ``customer_nodes_with_percentile`` where I calculated the number of days between ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` and added ``percentile_rank`` using the clause **PERCENT_RANK**.
- I created three tables for the 50th, 80th, and 95th percentiles to calculate the value of this percentile.
- I joined the calculated result into one table.


#### Result:
- The 50th, 80th, and 95th percentiles for every region are almost the same.

### 1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```sql
SELECT 
    txn_type,
    COUNT(txn_amount) AS number_of_transactions,
    SUM(txn_amount) AS sum_of_amount
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type;
```
#### Steps:
- I counted the numbers and the values of ``txn_amount`` grouped by ``txn_type``. 

#### Result:

...

***

### 2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(txn_amount)/COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id),1) AS avg_number_of_deposite,
    ROUND(AVG(txn_amount),0) AS avg_amount_of_deposite
FROM customer_transactions
WHERE txn_type = 'deposit';
```
#### Steps:
- I used the filter (**WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'** ) to include only the data about ``deposite`` in the calculation.
- I counted the average count of depisite using clauses **COUNT** (to calculate the number of all depisite) and **COUNT DISTINCT** (to calculate the number of all customers).
- I calculated the average deposit amount using clause **AVG**.


#### Result:

| avg_number_of_deposite | avg_amount_of_deposite |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 5.3                    | 509                    |

### 3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
 

```sql
WITH pivot_transactions AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MONTH(txn_date) AS date_month,
        SUM(
            CASE 
                WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 
                ELSE 0
            END) AS number_of_deposits,
        SUM(
            CASE 
                WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 
                ELSE 0
            END) AS number_of_purchases,   
        SUM(
            CASE 
                WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 
                ELSE 0
            END) AS number_of_withdrawals
    FROM customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id, date_month
)


SELECT
    date_month,
    COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM  pivot_transactions
WHERE 
    number_of_deposits > 1 AND 
    (number_of_purchases >= 1 OR number_of_withdrawals >= 1)
GROUP BY date_month;
```
#### Steps:
- I created a temporary table ``pivot_transactions`` where I calculated for each customer and month the number of deposits, purchases, and withdrawals. I calculated the number of each type of transaction ``txn_type`` using the clauses **SUM** and **CASE**.
Next, using the temporary table ``pivot_transactions`` I calculated the number of customers who made more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal (using clause **WHERE** with a few conditions) in each month.

#### Result:
...

### 4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month? 

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t4;

CREATE TABLE t4 (
    month_date int,
    txn_type varchar(10),
    txn_amount int
);

INSERT INTO t4
  (month_date, txn_type, txn_amount)
VALUES
  ('1', 'balance', '0'),
  ('2', 'balance', '0'),
  ('3', 'balance', '0'),
  ('4',  'balance', '0');


WITH customer_transaction_with_balance AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        ct.customer_id, 
        t4.month_date, 
        t4.txn_type, 
        t4.txn_amount
    FROM customer_transactions AS ct, t4
    UNION
    SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        MONTH(txn_date) AS month_date, 
        txn_type, 
        txn_amount
    FROM customer_transactions
),
month_aggregation_data AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        month_date,
        SUM(
            CASE 
                WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
                ELSE txn_amount * -1
            END) AS month_change
    FROM customer_transaction_with_balance
    GROUP BY customer_id, month_date
)

SELECT 
    *,
    SUM(month_change) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month_date) AS end_month_balance
FROM month_aggregation_data
WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,3,4,5); -- this filetr is only to limit the result
```

#### Steps:
- I created the extra table ``t4`` with four rows (include ``month_date`` a number from 1 to 4, ``txn_type`` it's eqal ``balance``, ``txn_amount`` it's eqal ``0``) which I added to the calculated data to have for every customer at least one record in each month.
- I created a temporary table ``customer_transaction_with_balance`` where I **UNION** the original data from tables ``customer_transactions`` and ``t4``.
- I aggregated the monthly amount of transactions for each customer in table ``month_aggregation_data``.
- In the final result, add a column with the ``end_month_balance``. I calculated the balance using the function **SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month_date)**.
- In the result, I showed data only for 5 to simplify.Â 

#### Result:

GROUP BY txn_type;
```
#### Steps:
- I counted 

#### Result:
