--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
--Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- generate a random list of 8 unique customer IDs.

WITH customers AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
	FROM subscriptions
)

SELECT 
	TOP 8 * 
FROM customers
ORDER BY NEWID();

-- select list of customer IDs (901, 470, 996, 918, 354, 168, 12, 432).

-- check how the customers change their plan over time based on popularity.

SELECT

)

SELECT

	COUNT(*) AS number_of_customers

--Based on the data, we can observe that:
--		Every customer starts with a free trial.
--		Customers may either churn (cancel their subscription) or maintain an active subscription.
--		No client downgraded their plan (switched from the Pro plan to the Basic plan)

--B. Data Analysis Questions--
------------------------------


-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS number_of_clients
