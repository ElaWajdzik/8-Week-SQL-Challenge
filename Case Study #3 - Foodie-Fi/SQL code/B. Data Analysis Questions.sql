WHERE customer_id<9;

-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM subscriptions;

-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

SELECT 
    MONTH(start_date) AS month_start,
    COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM subscriptions

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

SELECT 
    YEAR(start_date) AS year_start,
    plan_name,
    COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM subscriptions AS sub
JOIN plans

-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

SELECT

-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

WITH customers_plan AS (
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(plan_id ORDER BY start_date) AS plan_path
FROM subscriptions
GROUP BY customer_id)

SELECT

-- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

SELECT
    COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3 AND YEAR(start_date) = 2020;

-- 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

WITH customer_in_plan_3 AS (
SELECT
    customer_id,
    start_date AS upgrade_to_3
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3),

FROM customer_in_plan_3 AS c3

    ON c3.customer_id = csd.customer_id;

-- 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

WITH customer_in_plan_3 AS (
SELECT
    customer_id,
    start_date AS upgrade_to_3
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3),

GROUP BY customer_id),

SELECT 
    c3.customer_id,
    TRUNCATE((DATEDIFF(c3.upgrade_to_3,csd.start_date)-1)/30,0) AS category_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN TRUNCATE((DATEDIFF(c3.upgrade_to_3,csd.start_date)-1)/30,0)*30 != 0 THEN TRUNCATE((DATEDIFF(c3.upgrade_to_3,csd.start_date)-1)/30,0)*30+1
        ELSE TRUNCATE((DATEDIFF(c3.upgrade_to_3,csd.start_date)-1)/30,0)*30 
    END AS start_category,

FROM customer_in_plan_3 AS c3
JOIN customers_start_date AS csd
    ON c3.customer_id = csd.customer_id
GROUP BY c3.customer_id)

SELECT
    CONCAT(start_category,'-',end_category,' days') AS bucket,
    COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customers_in_category
GROUP BY category_id
ORDER BY category_id;


-- try how to work the function TRUNCATE()
-- SELECT TRUNCATE(((10-1)/3),0)

-- the function WIDTH_BUCKET() will be perfect to solve this problem, but it doesn't work in MySQL
-- WIDTH_BUCKET( expression, min, max, buckets)

-- try how the function NTILE() works, and if they can replace the function WIDTH_BUCKET()
-- NTILE(3) over (ORDER BY customer_id)

-- the first way of solving with the function CASE() to set up category. I don't think that is the best option.

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, 
write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join 
to make your explanations a bit easier!
