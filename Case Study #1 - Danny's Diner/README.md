# Case Study #1: üçú Danny's Diner 
<img src="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/case-study-designs/1.png" alt="Image Danny's Diner - the taste of success" height="400">

## Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so at the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny‚Äôs Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but has no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.


## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
* ```sales```
* ```menu```
* ```members```

You can inspect the entity relationship diagram and example data below.

## Relationship Diagram

<img width="404" alt="graf1" src="https://github.com/ElaWajdzik/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/26794982/f8120a7a-13d9-49e9-92f4-2077ec3041a9">


Additionally, in the code, I created constraints related to primary and foreign keys. The information about the constraints comes from the relationship diagram.

````sql
ALTER TABLE members
ALTER COLUMN customer_id VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE members
ADD CONSTRAINT members_customer_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);

ALTER TABLE menu
ALTER COLUMN product_id INT NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE menu
ADD CONSTRAINT menu_product_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT sales_product_id_fk 
FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES menu(product_id);

--I can't create a foreign key constraint between members.customer_id and sales.customer_id because not every customer is also a member
````

## Case Study Questions
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

The complete SQL code is available [here](https://github.com/ElaWajdzik/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%231%20-%20Danny's%20Diner/SQL%20code).

**Thank you in advance for reading.** If you have any comments on my work, please let me know. My email address is ela.wajdzik@gmail.com.

Additionally, I am open to new work opportunities. If you are looking for someone with my skills (or know of someone who is), I would be grateful for any information.

***

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT
	s.customer_id,
    COUNT(s.customer_id) AS number_orders, 	--is not necessary to count how many orders do each customer
	SUM(m.price) AS total_amount
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Merge the ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables using **JOIN**, where ```customer_id``` comes from the ```sales``` table and ```price``` comes from the ```menu``` table.
- Find out the ```total_amount``` for each customer using **SUM** and **GROUP BY**.
- Find out the ```number_orders``` for each customer using **COUNT** and **GROUP BY**.

#### Result:
| customer_id | number_orders | total_amount |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| A           | 6             | 76           |
| B           | 6             | 74           |
| C           | 3             | 36           |


- Customer **A** ordered 6 products and spent $76.
- Customer **B** ordered 6 products and spent $74.
- Customer **C** ordered 3 products and spent $36.

***

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS number_of_days
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use **COUNT(DISTINCT ```order_date```)** to count the number of distinct days of visits. 

#### Result:
| customer_id | number_of_days   |
| ----------- | -----------------|
| A           | 4                |
| B           | 6                |
| C           | 2                |

- Customer **A** visited Danny's Diner on 4 different days.
- Customer **B** visited Danny's Diner on 6 different days.
- Customer **C** visited Danny's Diner on 2 different days.

***

### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

````sql
WITH sales_with_ranking AS (
	SELECT
		s.*,
		m.product_name,									--add the name of the product
		DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS ranking	--product ranking order
	FROM sales s
	LEFT JOIN menu m
	ON m.product_id = s.product_id)

SELECT
	customer_id,
	product_name
FROM sales_with_ranking
WHERE ranking = 1			--select only the first order
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;	--group by the same products
````

If I work with PostgreSQL, I will make use of the construct called **SELECT DISTINCT ON ()** and **ORDER BY order_date ASC**. 

#### Steps:
- Create a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the ranking of orders using the **WITH** clause.
- Calculate the ranking of orders using the **DENSE_RANK** function. 

#### Result:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | -------------|
| A           | sushi        |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | curry        |
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer **A** bought two dishes, sushi and curry, on their first purchase.
- Customer **B** first purchased curry.
- Customer **C** first purchased ramen.

***

### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

````sql
SELECT 
	m.product_name,
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders  --counts every order from every client
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m
	ON m.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name;
````

#### Steps:
- Use **COUNT** to calculate the number of orders for each dish.
- Order the results in descending order using **ORDER BY** with the **DESC** parameter to determine which item was purchased most frequently.

#### Result:
| product_name | number_of_orders |
|--------------|------------------|
| ramen        | 8                |
| curry        | 4                |
| sushi        | 3                |

- The most frequently purchased item was ramen. The customers at Danny's Diner bought it 8 times, which is twice as many as curry.

***

### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

````sql
WITH sales_with_popularity_by_client AS (
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id,
		m.product_name,
		COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders,								--counts every product bought by every client
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking	--the most popular product ranking by each client
	FROM sales s
	LEFT JOIN menu m
		ON m.product_id=s.product_id
	GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name)

SELECT
	customer_id,
	product_name,
	number_of_orders		--this information is not necessary
FROM sales_with_popularity_by_client
WHERE ranking = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a temporary table (using **WITH**) to generate a ranking of popularity (using **DENSE_RANK**).
- Select only the rows from the temporary table **WHERE** the ranking of popularity is equal to 1.

#### Result:
| customer_id | product_name | number_of_orders |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| A           | ramen        | 3                |
| B           | curry        | 2                |
| B           | ramen        | 2                |
| B           | sushi        | 2                |
| C           | ramen        | 3                |

- The most popular item for each customer was ramen.
- Additionally, customer **B** liked every item (ramen, sushi, and curry).

***

### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

````sql
WITH members_sales_with_ranking AS (
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id,
		s.order_date,
		s.product_id,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) AS ranking		--order of the first products bought by members 
	FROM sales s
	INNER JOIN members m
	ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
	WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date)

SELECT
	s.customer_id,
	m.product_name
FROM members_sales_with_ranking s
LEFT JOIN menu m
	ON m.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.ranking = 1		--select only the first order placed after becoming a member
````

#### Steps:
- As in question 5, create a temporary table (using **WITH**) to generate a ranking of orders (using **DENSE_RANK**).
- Select the first order for each member after joining, using the ranking of orders, and filter to include only the top-ranked value (using the **WHERE** clause).


#### Result:
| customer_id | product_name |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

- After customer **A** became a member, they first purchased curry.
- After customer **B** became a member, they first  purchased sushi.

***

### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

````sql
WITH sales_before_membership_with_ranking AS (
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id,
		s.order_date,
		s.product_id,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS ranking		--order of the last products bought after becoming a member 
	FROM sales s
	INNER JOIN members m
		ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
	WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date)

SELECT 
	s.customer_id,
	m.product_name
FROM sales_before_membership_with_ranking s
LEFT JOIN menu m
	ON m.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.ranking = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Use a similar function as in question 6. The main change is to use **DENSE_RANK** in descending order.

#### Result:
| customer_id | product_name |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | sushi        |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer **A** in the order placed before becoming a member, bought two types of items - sushi and curry.
- Customer **B** in the order placed before becoming a member, bought sushi.

According to the results from questions 6 and 7, customers **A** and **B** bought the same product just before and just after becoming members.

***

### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

````sql
SELECT 
	s.customer_id,
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_item,		--count the number of items
	SUM(mn.price) AS spent_amount		--sum of the prices
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN members m
	ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
INNER JOIN menu mn
	ON mn.product_id = s.product_id

WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date		--filter the orders bought before becoming a member
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use aggregate functions **COUNT** and **SUM**.
- Join all three tables to create the result.

#### Result:
| customer_id | number_of_item | spent_amount |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| A           | 2              | 25           |
| B           | 3              | 40           |

- Customer **A**, before becoming a member, spent $25 at Danny's Diner and bought 2 items.
- Customer **B**, before becoming a member, spent $40 at Danny's Diner and bought 3 items (2 different type of items).

***

### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

````sql
SELECT 
	s.customer_id,
	SUM(CASE s.product_id
			WHEN 1 THEN mn.price * 2 * 10	--double points for sushi orders
			ELSE mn.price * 10			--calculate the points 1$ = 10 points
		END) AS number_of_points
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN members m
	ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
INNER JOIN menu mn
	ON mn.product_id = s.product_id

WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- In this problem, I assume that points can only be collected by members, and only for orders placed after joining.
- Use the function **CASE** to check if ordered items if the ordered item was ```sushi``` (```product_id = 1```) and then multiplied by 2 number of points. The number of points is calculated like ```price``` * 10.

#### Result:
| customer_id | number_of_points |
|-------------|------------------|
| A           | 510              |
| B           | 440              |


- Customer **A** collected 510 points, and customer **B** collected 440 points.

It is interesting to see what they can get with these points.


***

### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

````sql
SELECT 
	s.customer_id,
	SUM(CASE
			WHEN DATEDIFF(DAY, m.join_date, s.order_date) < 7 THEN mn.price * 2		--double points for all items purchased after joining the program
			ELSE mn.price
		END) * 10 AS number_of_points
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN members m
	ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
INNER JOIN menu mn
	ON mn.product_id = s.product_id

WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date	--filter the orders placed after becoming a member
AND s.order_date < '2021-02-01'		--filter the orders at the end of January
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- It is important not to increase the multiplier for sushi to 4 during the first week of membership.
- Use the **SUM** and **CASE** functions to calculate the number of points earned in the first 7 days after becoming a member, and after that. In the first week, $1 is equal to 20 points; after that, $1 is equal to 10 points.
- Limit the data to orders placed by the end of January.


#### Result:

| customer_id | points |
|-------------|--------|
| A           | 1020   |
| B           | 320    |

- Customer **A** collected 1020 points.
- Customer **B** collected 320 points.

## Bonus Questions

### Join All The Things

Recreate the following table output using the available data

| customer_id | order_date | product_name | price | member |
|-------------|------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| A           | 2021-01-01 | curry	      | 15	  | N      |


````sql
SELECT
	s.customer_id,
	s.order_date,
	mn.product_name,
	mn.price,
	CASE	
		WHEN m.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'	--an additional column with the value 'Y' if the order comes from a customer who is a member, and 'N' if not
		ELSE 'N'
	END AS member
FROM sales s
INNER JOIN menu mn
	ON mn.product_id = s.product_id
LEFT JOIN members m
	ON m.customer_id = s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Join all three tables to create the expected table. From the ``sales`` table, I need date about ``customer_id`` and ``order_date``. From the ``menu`` table I need date about ¬†``product_name`` and ``price``. The date from the ``members`` table I need to calculate the value of ``member`` column.

#### Result:

### Rank All The Things
Create a table like before in **Join All The Things** but add the ``ranking``. The ``ranking`` of customer products is only for member purchases, and the ``ranking`` value is **null** when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.


````sql
WITH full_table AS (
	SELECT
		s.customer_id,
		s.order_date,
		mn.product_name,
		mn.price,
		CASE 
			WHEN m.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'
			ELSE 'N'
		END AS member
	FROM sales s
	INNER JOIN menu mn
		ON mn.product_id = s.product_id
	LEFT JOIN members m
		ON m.customer_id = s.customer_id)

SELECT 
	*,
	CASE 
		WHEN member = 'N' THEN null
		ELSE RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, member ORDER BY order_date ASC)		--an additional column with the ranking of orders, but only for orders made by a member
	END AS ranking
FROM full_table;
````

#### Steps:
- Create the table as before, but using a Common Table Expresion (CTE) with **WITH**.
- In the second step, add the ``ranking`` column, with ranking applied only to data involving the member purchases.

#### Result:


<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a40df2c-521c-442b-aa89-96698c4382bd" height="450">
