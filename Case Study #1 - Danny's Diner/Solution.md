````sql
SELECT 
    sales.customer_id,
    COUNT(sales.customer_id) AS number_orders,
    SUM(menu.price) AS amount_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS sales
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:

| B           | 6             | 74           |
| C           | 3             | 36           |
